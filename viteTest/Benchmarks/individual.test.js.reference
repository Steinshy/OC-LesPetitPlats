/**
 * REFERENCE FILE - Original individual.test.js structure
 *
 * This file documents the original structure of individual.test.js before it was
 * split into three separate benchmark test files:
 * - filterByIngredients.test.js
 * - filterByAppliances.test.js
 * - filterByUstensils.test.js
 *
 * The original file contained benchmark tests for filtering recipes by:
 * 1. Ingredients (single, multiple, empty)
 * 2. Appliances (single, multiple, empty)
 * 3. Ustensils (single, multiple, empty)
 *
 * Each test category included memory usage tracking and performance benchmarks.
 *
 * This refactoring improves maintainability by separating concerns into
 * dedicated test files for each filter type.
